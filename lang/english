# This is the base 3hs translation file.
# All other translations should derive from this file.
# If you want to translate 3hs in your language please contact us in the hShop discord server.

# Some strings have a comment which indicates a context, this may help while translating
#  - If you require context for anything else feel free to ask
#  - %<n> where <n> is a number from 1-9 is a variable, their meaning is explained in the matching comment
#  - The value of the variable will literally be substituted (replaced)
#  - if this doesn't work in your language you may have to write a bit of code to work around it
#    - please take a look at the example string in english "size_plus_block"
#    - if you need help feel free to ask
# UI_GLYPH_ is a prefix for buttons in the system fonts i.e. UI_GLYPH_B is the B button on your 3DS
#  - They should be kept exactly as-is, they should be encircled by spaces
#    - Even if your language has no such things, not having a space causes ugly clamping
# PAGE_ is a prefix for a URL to a hShop page
#  - They should be kept exactly as-is, the actual URL gets placed in place of the PAGE_ letters
# Preserve newlines ("enter"s), they are added for stylistic purposes, most things should neatly wrap
# Although text wraps in most cases, it's for the best not make your translation too verbose
#  - Text wrapping means the text continues on the next line if it's too large
#  - Strings marked with "nowrap" don't wrap.
#  - Strings marked with "button" use button wrap
#    - This means they gradually expand in size as the string gets larger
#    - This does not mean they wrap to the next line
#  - Strings marked with "selector" have a maximum length (of 200 pixels)
#  - Strings marked with "scroll" scroll sideways, for example all setting titles use this
#    - Strings that scroll obviously can't wrap
# If your language is officially supported by Nintendo, use their translations for their terms
#   - For example, "blocks", "HOME menu", "theme"
#
#
# Any questions and new translations can be posted in the hShop discord channel

# The name of the language this file is for in that language (i.e. Espa√±ol for Spanish)

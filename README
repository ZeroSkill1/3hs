  = = Special thanks to = =

The developers of nlohmann::json (license MIT, see: LICENSE.nlohann-json.TXT), of which their library is bundled,
Ghost retard, who made me rethink some obfuscation,
everyone in the hShop discord channel, for giving me motivation by insisting a 3ds client is too hard to make,
Coin, for his inspiring lua hShop client,
and Crem√®, for making some nice art.

      = = Building = =

Requirements:
 - devkitarm
 - libctru
 - citro2d
 - citro3d

Run `make` for a debug build and `make RELEASE=1 cia` for a release cia build.

Other variables used in the building process:
 - VERSION=version-int
 - DEVICE_ID=device-id-int
 - HS_DEBUG_SERVER="debug-server"
 - HS_UPDATE_BASE="update-url"
 - HS_BASE_LOC="api-url"
 - HS_CDN_BASE="cdn-url"
 - HS_SITE_LOC="hsite-url"

To successfully build you need
  HS_UPDATE_BASE && (HS_DEBUG_SERVER || (HS_BASE_LOC && HS_CDN_BASE && HS_SITE_LOC))

Additionally you need a file called source/hsapi_auth.c with the following contents
 #include <string.h>
 const char *hsapi_user = "api-user";
 const int hsapi_token_length = token-length-int;
 void hsapi_token(char *ret) { memcpy(ret, "api-token", hsapi_token_length); }

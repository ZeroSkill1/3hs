			The 3hs template language&trade; is a simple templating language designed
			to work with the hlink http server. As such, it includes only a few essential
			features. The features it implements are:
			<ul>
				<li>conditionals (<em>if</em>/<em>else-if</em>/<em>else</em>)</li>
				<li>loops (<em>foreach</em>)</li>
				<li>variables ([<em>variable-name</em>])</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			To use variables you just place the name of the variable between square brackets
			([ and ]) like this: [<em>variable-name</em>]. These variables may also be
			functions. You know whether a symbol is a function or variable by the name.
			Functions have names ending with <em>()</em> (i.e. <em>some-cool-function()</em>)
		</p>
		<p>
			Functions may also be conditional functions. They are marked with a question mark
			(<em>?</em>) at the end of the function name (i.e. <em>some-cool-cond-func?()</em>)
			You can use these functions in conditional expressions. You can execute conditional
			expressions with <em>if</em>, <em>else-if</em> (which is sugar syntax for a normal
			<em>if</em>) or <em>else</em>. An example:
			<hr/>
			<pre>&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		[[if eq?() a a]]
			a == a
		[[else]]
			a != a
		[[end]]

		[[if not?() eq?() a a]]
			a != a
		[[else]]
			a == a
		[[end]]
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
			<hr/>
			The 3hs template language&trade; currently has these built-in conditional functions:
			<ul>
				<li><em>eq?()</em> &mdash; checks for the equality of 2 given arguments</li>
				<li><em>not?()</em> &mdash; negates the conditional expression that follows</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Loops are executed via a <em>foreach</em>. You can trigger one with
			<em>[[foreach &lt;iterator-variable-name&gt; in &lt;array-variable-name&gt;]]</em>
			and end one with an <em>[[end]]</em>.
